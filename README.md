# ForestQuery Global Deforestation Report (1990 to 2016)

## Introduction
ForestQuery's mission is to combat deforestation worldwide and raise awareness about its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong. The data analysis team has used SQL to combine these tables and to query them to identify areas of concern and to learn from successful conservation efforts.

## Global Situation
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41,282,694.9 km2 in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39,958,245.9 km2, a loss of 1,324,449 km2, or a 3.21% decrease. The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1,279,999.98 square kilometers).

## Regional Outlook
In 2016, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 31.38%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America and the Caribbean, with 46.16%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was the Middle East and North Africa, with 2.07% forestation. In 1990, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America and the Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was the Middle East and North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.
