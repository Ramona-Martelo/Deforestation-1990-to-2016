# ForestQuery Global Deforestation Report (1990 to 2016)

## Introduction
ForestQuery's mission is to combat deforestation worldwide and raise awareness about its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong. The data analysis team has used SQL to combine these tables and to query them to identify areas of concern and to learn from successful conservation efforts.

## Global Situation
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41,282,694.9 km2 in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39,958,245.9 km2, a loss of 1,324,449 km2, or a 3.21% decrease. The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1,279,999.98 square kilometers).

## Regional Outlook
In 2016, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 31.38%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America and the Caribbean, with 46.16%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was the Middle East and North Africa, with 2.07% forestation. In 1990, the percentage of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America and the Caribbean, with 51.03%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was the Middle East and North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.

## COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL

## A. SUCCESS STORIES
China is a success story in terms of forest area increase, with a gain of 527,229.06 km2 from 1990 to 2016, followed by the United States with an increase of 79,200 km2. Iceland had the largest percent change in forest area with an increase of 213.66%.

## B. LARGEST CONCERNS
The countries with the largest decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by square kilometer were Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Tanzania. When analyzing the data by percent decrease, Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, Mauritania, and Honduras were the top 5 countries. Nigeria was the only country to rank in the top 5 for both measures, indicating a significant opportunity to stop the decline and lead remedial efforts.

# 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

● What have I learned from the World Bank data?
● Which countries should we focus on over others?

I learned that many regions in the world are increasing in forest area. For example, Europe and
Central Asia, North America, East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, and Middle East and North
Africa are all increasing in forest area and forest area percentage. However, that the world has
decreased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 underscores how much forest Latin America and
the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa have lost. I would recommend focusing on the countries
with the largest absolute forest area change, found in table 3.1. The top 5 countries in this
category are Brazil, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Tanzania. While looking at countries that
have high percentage forestation decrease is useful, I think focusing on the countries that are
reducing the most forest by land area is most important. Lastly, I think partnering with China to
find best practices for increasing forest area would be very helpful.
